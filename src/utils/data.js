export const ABOUT_ME = {
  content: `I'm a passionate Frontend Developer with a strong foundation in building responsive, user-friendly web applications. With a keen eye for design and performance, I specialize in crafting seamless digital experiences using modern technologies like React.js, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and Django. My goal is to bridge the gap between aesthetics and functionality, ensuring every project I work on is both visually appealing and highly performant.

In addition to my software development journey, I bring 20+ years of proven success as a Manufacturing Manager in the PCBA industry, where I led teams, drove operational efficiency, and consistently took companies toward profitability and growth through innovation and change management. Recognizing the need for speed and accuracy in the manufacturing process, I created several custom applications for the PCBA industry to streamline workflows, reduce errors, and accelerate delivery timelines.

My journey in web development started with curiosityâ€”how does the web work? Fast forward to today, I've built dynamic applications, collaborated with cross-functional teams, and combined my manufacturing leadership experience with technical expertise to solve real-world industry challenges. I love tackling problems, optimizing user experiences, and bringing creative ideas to life through code.

Let's build something amazing together!`,
